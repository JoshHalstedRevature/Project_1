For Project 1, I will be using the Google News API (along with Hive) to extract news trends about the general topic "money". The timeline of the queries will include from January 20 to today. The general analysis questions will be:

1) When I query headlines for keywords such as "inflation", "shortages", and "rising prices", which news outlets do readers decide to choose? (Run three separate queries) These are sorted by relevance. (reduce keys)
2) Within the context of the headline, what other words are often used in conjunction with these keywords? (reduce keys)
3) Is there a certain author that attracts so much attention for these issues, or is it spread out? (reduce keys)
4) Where (in terms of geographic location) are most of these articles coming from?
5) Are there outlets that are predicting when these things might end? If so, who is making these predictions? (search headline for additional keyword "end", "transitory")
6) Are there outlets claiming that they know what is causing these things? (search headline for additional keyword "cause", "causing", "caused", "resulting")
