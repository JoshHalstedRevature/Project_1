For Project 1, I will be using the Google News API (along with Hive) to extract news trends about the general topic "money". The timeline of the queries will include from January 20 to today. The general analysis questions will be:

1) What are the top 5 trending topics that media outlets publish about when the query "economy" is entered? What about "finance"?
2) How have the number of mentions for "inflation" changed from the end of Q1 through Q4? Which outlets support the claim that inflation is "transitory" versus "permanent"?
3) When did media outlets start reporting about supply chain disruptions? Which items have been mentioned as being in short supply by media outlets over the past three months?
4) How have the number of mentions for "stock market crash" changed from the end of Q1 through Q4? 
5) What do news outlets say today is a "hedge against inflation"?
6) What stocks are media outlets bearish and bullish about today?
